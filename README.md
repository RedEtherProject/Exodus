# Exodus
A Mass Migration into Web3 as we venture to the age of decentralization

Goals of Building a Decentralized React MVP:
1. Reading and Writing Data from a block chain
2. Business Logic to run application purpose


Note: create-react-app is no longer global, if it is in your global directory, use:
> npm ininstall -g create-react-app

Then: 
> npx create-react-app exodus --template typescript 
tsconfig has already been added





Different Types of Networks on Ether:
1. Local Network: Ganache 
2. Testnet(ropsten, rinkeby, )
3. Mainnet(Requires ETH)

We will be developing on the local Ganache Network,

Install a wallet like MetaMask for the browser to interact with the Ether Blockchain. 
Add to Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en
Metamask does this by injecting the scope of Ethereum Blockchain into the browser once it is configured through through. 

> npm install -g truffle@5.0.2






Switch to top Folder in order to create a "Server" Folder
> truffle init
Creates a contracts and migrations folder
> touch package.json
Install dependencies in root folder

Necessary:

> Solidy Contracts
> Ganache(A Truffle IDE)
> Metamask-
> A version of Web3, Web3js, 


In the Migrations.sol folder in contracts, 
Make Sure the version is exact
> pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

Migrations are essentially action triggers, or dispatched actions, as the entire blockchain can only have a single state in a moment in time. 
> change the contract name to the purpose of the business logic of the applciation, eg "ToDontList"

> truffle compile


In order to run the contract on a personal blockchain their config must match ganache defaults, so change the truffle-config by uncommenting the following sections:
- truffle-config.js
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "*" // Match any network id
    }
  },
  solc: {
    optimizer: {
      enabled: true,
      runs: 200
    }
  }
}


In the root folder:
> touch migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js

Each time a new smart contract is created programmtically updates the state through a migration. 

Create the migration file:
const Exodus = artifacts.require("Migrations");

module.exports = function(deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(Exodus);
};


- 2_deploy_contracts.js:

module.exports = function(deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(Exodus);
};



With ganache open:
> truffle migrate

> truffle console
In the cconsole:
> exodus = await Migrations.deployed()


add functionality to the contract, and reset the migrate
> truffle migrate --reset

> truffle console
> exodus = await Exodus.deployed()
Mapped as getting all

> exodus = await Exodus.deployed(1)
